# The New York Times Article Redirect Service
- This project was a technical challenge given by Turing School of Software and Design.
- The goal of this project was to extract data from a provided API and display that data in a UI that allows the user to scroll through articles and view a small details page about each one.

# User Flows
- When a User comes to the Home page, they will see a list of articles from the "Homepage" section of the New York Times website.
- A User can scroll through the displayed articles and click on one.
- Upon the clicking of an "Article Card", the User will be directed to that articles Details Page where they will be able to see more information about that article.
- On the Details Page, the User will see a link they can click to check out the full article at the official New York Times website.
- At any point the User can use the Filter dropdown to display a list of articles from that particular section.
